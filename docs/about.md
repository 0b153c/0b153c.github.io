# What is this blog about?

A work in progress (like my life). The plan is to post **HTB** **CTF** write-ups and journal my Cyber-Security journey.  

## What is a CTF?

Short for “Capture The Flag”, CTFs are a challenge, using intentionally vulnerable systems designed for
training and/or competitive use. A CTF normally consists of two objectives:

1. Reveal, or capture, the user flag (user.txt)
2. Reveal, or capture, the system flag (root.txt)

Individuals are encouraged to utilize “whatever means necessary” to accomplish the objectives. Reaching
the first objective serves as a check-point towards the end-game: getting the root flag to prove successful
compromise of the entire system.  

## What is HTB?

Short for “[Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/)”, HTB is an online community dedicated to providing a safe and reliable
environment for individuals to enhance their offensive security skills using more contemporary CTFs that
include real-world examples. The community adds in new challenges, while archiving older ones, every
week. Points, rewarded for completing challenge objectives, are used to increase user rankings—therefore--
encouraging users to return for additional challenges (through competition).
